    <h4>What's opinion score?</h4>
    <p>
        The opinion score produced by this app measures the extent to which a tweet advocates for
        practicing COVID health measures (such as social distancing, wearing a mask,
        or staying at home) and calls people to action, ranging from -1.0(against) to 1.0(for).
        Note that a score of zero means the tweet is neutral or ambiguous about COVID
        health measures, or is irrelevant to COVID-19.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some examples of opinion score calculated by this app: </p>
