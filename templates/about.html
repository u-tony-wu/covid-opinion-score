    <h3>About This Project</h3>

    <p>One of the most effective ways to combat COVID-19 is to make sure that everyone
        practices safety measures from the beginning, such as wearing a mask, social distancing,
        or staying at home. It is thus important to understand how the public awareness of
        these COVID health measures has evolved since the outbreak, and from there shed light
        on how public health campaigns could best boost peopleâ€™s awareness of the appropriate
        disease control actions during a pandemic.</p>
    <p>
        To achieve this goal, this project focuses on investigating public awareness of health
        measures, during COVID-19 pandemic, as reflected in tweets. A machine learning-based
        language model has been built and trained on a corpus of thousands of COVID-related
        tweets, identified via six hashtags (in alphabetical order): #coronahoax, #nomask,
        #plandemic, #scamdemic, #socialdistance, #wearamask. More specifically, the model consists
        of a pretrained distilBERT component that generates a 768-dimensional sentence embedding
        for input tweet text and a two-layer fully-connected neural network that converts sentence
        embedding into opinion score.</p>

    <p>Note that distilBERT is a "distilled" version of BERT: it only has
        6 transformer blocks. Due to limited computational power, this project uses distilBERT
        as a faster and lighter alternative to BERT to generate embedding for input text.  </p>
